* Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a array,
* and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
• Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza
* instead of printing just the name of the pizza.
* For each pizza you should have one line of output containing
* a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.

• Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states how much you like pizza.
* The output should consist of three or more lines about the kinds of
* pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such as I really love pizza!
