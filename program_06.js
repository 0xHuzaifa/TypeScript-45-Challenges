* The trim() method in JavaScript and TypeScript only removes whitespace characters
* from the beginning and end of a string.
* It does not remove whitespace characters from within the string itself.
*
* /\s/g is a regular expression that matches all whitespace characters (\s),
* and the g flag indicates a global match (matches all occurrences, not just the first one).
* replace() method replaces all matches of the regular expression with an empty string,
* effectively removing all whitespace characters from the string.
* This will result in "SomeName" as the output, with all whitespace characters removed.
