/*
* Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. 
* The function should take in an artist name and an album title, 
* and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information. 
* Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
* Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. 
* Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
* If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. 
* Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
